	// write your code here

//        Your program should include at least (5) classes: Zoo, Pen, Animal, BabyAnimal, and ZooDemo. Done
//
//                A Zoo should have (1) property: a collection of Pens. I think I'm done???
//
//        A Pen should have (2) properties: a collection of Animals and a collection of BabyAnimals. I think I'm done???
//
//                Animal should have at least (3) properties (such as "species", "size", "gender"). Animal should have a
//                parameterized constructor. I think I'm done???
//
//                BabyAnimal should inherit from Animal and should have at least (1) additional instance variable.
//                BabyAnimal should have a parameterized constructor that calls its superclass to construct part of a
//                BabyAnimal object.
//
//                Write a program in ZooDemo that allows the zookeeper to:
//        Set up new Pens
//        Remove Pens
//        Add an Animal to a Pen
//        Add a BabyAnimal to a Pen
//        Remove Animals and BabyAnimals from pens
//        Display all the Animals in a Pen
//        Display all the Animals in the Zoo.
//                Bonus
//        Your program should not allow the zookeeper to add more than (4) total Animals or (10) total BabyAnimals to
//        a Pen.
//                Your program should not allow the zookeeper to add a BabyAnimal to a Pen unless you already have a
//                male Animal and a female Animal living in the Pen.
//        Your program should include an additional class, Habitat, which should be a property of Animal & BabyAnimal
//        and should describe what the animal's habitat is like (desert, forest, hot, cold, etc.).
